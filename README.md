# TilemapToPngUnity
A simple script that is used to convert a unity tilemap to PNG

# How to use
To use this script, simply add it to your tilemap, assign the gameobject with the tilemap you want to save, assign a camera (it is recommended to create a new camera object for this), and enter your pixels per unit. 

# Warning
It is recommended to disable all other objects in the scene before exporting the tilemap. The script will attempt to hide them but if you want to be safe I recommend disabling them yourself.
